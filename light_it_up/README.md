# `micro::bit v2 Embedded Discovery Book`

The published text of this book is at
<https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery-mb2> for your
perusing pleasure.

-----

Discover the world of microcontrollers through
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)! This book provides an
introduction to microcontrollers and how to use Rust with
them.

## Book Versions

This book is the current and best-maintained version of the
Rust Embedded Discovery Book. It is intended to be used with
the [BBC Micro:Bit v2](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/)
(MB2) development circuit board.

(There are currently two *deprecated* older versions of this
book. [One
version](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery)
is based on the [STM F3
Discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html)
development board.  The [second
version](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit)
is slightly newer and is based on the [BBC Micro:Bit
v1](https://microbit.org/get-started/features/overview/#original-micro:bit)
and v2 circuit boards.  Unless you are determined to work
with older and less-well-supported hardware, and
corresponding older and less-well-supported books, we
recommend getting an MB2 and using this book instead. The
MB2 is available for about US$20 from many online
suppliers.)

## What Do You Want To Do?

Here's some ways to get started:

- Work through [this
  book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery-mb2) with
  an MB2
- Start working on the examples from this repository
- You've got questions?
    - Have a look at our [discussions section on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery-mb2/discussions)
    - Maybe it has already been answered
    - If not, start a new discussion
- You've found an issue?
    - Have a look at our [issues on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery-mb2/issues)
    - Maybe there is already a workaround
    - If not, please open a new one - or even better - a [pull
      request](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery-mb2/pulls) for solving
      it
- You want to talk to a human being directly?
    - The general Rust [Embedded Matrix
      chat](https://matrix.to/#/#rust-embedded:matrix.org)
      is good for questions beyond the basics. Please be
      respectful of the bandwidth of folks there, though:
      it's a busy place

Have fun and enjoy!
