# Embedded Setup

Let's take a look at our first program to compile. Check the `examples/init.rs` file:

``` rust
{{#include examples/init.rs}}
```

Microcontroller programs are different from standard programs in two aspects: `#![no_std]` and
`#![no_main]`.

The `no_std` attribute says that this program won't use the `std` crate, which assumes an underlying
OS; the program will instead use the `core` crate, a subset of `std` that can run on bare metal
systems (that is, systems without OS abstractions like files and sockets).

The `no_main` attribute says that this program won't use the standard `main` interface, which is
tailored for command line applications that receive arguments. Instead of the standard `main` we'll
use the `entry` attribute from the [`cortex-m-rt`] crate to define a custom entry point. In this
program we have named the entry point `main`, but any other name could have been used. The entry
point function must have signature `fn() -> !`; this type indicates that the function can't return.
This means that the program never terminates by returning from `main`: if the compiler detects that
this would be possible it will refuse to compile your program.

If you are a careful observer, you'll also notice there is a possibly-hidden `.cargo` directory in
the Cargo project as well. This directory contains a Cargo configuration file `.cargo/config.toml`.

```toml
{{#include .cargo/config.toml}}
```

This file tweaks the linking process to tailor the memory layout of the program to the requirements
of the target device.  This modified linking process is a requirement of the `cortex-m-rt`
crate. The `.cargo/config.toml` file also tells Cargo how to build and run code on our MB2.

There is also an `Embed.toml` file here:

```toml
{{#include Embed.toml}}
```

This file tells `cargo-embed` that:

- We are working with an NRF52833.
- We want to halt the chip after flashing it, so our program stops before `main`.
- We want to disable RTT. RTT is a protocol that allows the chip to send text to a debugger.
  You have already seen RTT in action: it was the protocol that sent "Hello World" in chapter 3.
- We want to enable GDB. This will be required for the debugging procedure.

Now that we've seen what's going on, let's start by building this program.
